#+title: BadNews: Matrix Bot, Bringer of Bad News

* What is this?

=BadNews= is a [[https://matrix.org][Matrix]] bot, watching your systemd/journald logs, and reporting
bad news to you.

* Why?

A mix of wanting to toy around with the [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk][matrix_sdk crate]] and getting some
simple alerts from my hosted services.

* Setup

Write up a configuration file at =config.yaml=:

#+begin_src yaml
homeserver: "https://matrix.example.net"
username: "bad-news"
password: "matrix password for user bad-news"
state_dir: "state/"
room_id: "!DeaDbEef:example.net"
units:
  - nginx.service
#+end_src

Then run the bot:

#+begin_src sh
cargo run -- --config config.yaml
#+end_src

* Contributing

Please send patches to [[~alarsyo/patches@lists.sr.ht]] with the prefix =PATCH
bad-news=.

You can use the following commands to set up =git= appropriately;

#+begin_src shell
git config sendemail.to '~alarsyo/patches@lists.sr.ht'
git config format.subjectPrefix 'PATCH bad-news'
#+end_src
